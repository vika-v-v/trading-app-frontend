# Test the app
There is a user <i>test@test.de</i> with the password <i>testtest123</i> where the data is demonstrated. There is no backend provided in this repository, so the data is not saved, but you can click through the app using the test user. You can also register, but the account will not be saved as there is no database. But during the development the app was tested with the actual backend server so if all the requests in docu/API_REQUESTS.md provided, there should be no problems with saving the data.

# Switch mock/no-mock
